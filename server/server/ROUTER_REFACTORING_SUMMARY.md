# Router Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refactoring of server routers to implement consistent JSON response envelopes and comprehensive unit testing.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Separate Router Files ✅
Created and refactored separate router files:
- `routes/auth.js` - Authentication and profile management
- `routes/users.js` - User CRUD operations (admin-only)
- `routes/sessions.js` - Session management 
- `routes/busySlots.js` - Busy slot management
- `routes/notifications.js` - Notification management

### 2. Consistent JSON Response Envelope ✅
Implemented consistent response format across all endpoints:
```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "data": any,
  "error": string,
  "message": string
}
```

#### Response Utility Functions
Created `utils/response.js` with helper functions:
- `sendSuccess(res, data, statusCode, message)` - For successful responses
- `sendError(res, error, statusCode, data)` - For error responses

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Auth Router (`/api/auth`)
- `POST /register` - User registration
- `POST /login` - User authentication  
- `GET /profile` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /profile` - Update current user profile
- `GET /verify` - Verify JWT token

#### Users Router (`/api/users`) - Admin Only
- `GET /` - List all users
- `GET /trainers` - List only trainers
- `GET /:id` - Get user by ID
- `POST /` - Create new user
- `PUT /:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /:id` - Delete user
- `GET /profile` - Get profile (backwards compatibility)
- `PUT /profile` - Update profile (backwards compatibility)

#### Sessions Router (`/api/sessions`)
- `GET /` - List sessions (admin: all, trainer: own)
- `GET /:id` - Get session by ID
- `POST /` - Create new session
- `PUT /:id` - Update session (admin only)
- `DELETE /:id` - Delete session (admin only)
- `PATCH /:id/attendance` - Toggle attendance (trainer only)
- `PUT /:id/approve` - Approve/reject session (admin only)

#### Busy Slots Router (`/api/busy-slots`)
- `GET /` - List busy slots (admin: all, trainer: own)
- `GET /:id` - Get busy slot by ID
- `POST /` - Create busy slot (trainer only)
- `PUT /:id` - Update busy slot (trainer only)
- `DELETE /:id` - Delete busy slot (trainer only)

#### Notifications Router (`/api/notifications`)
- `GET /` - List notifications (admin only, with pagination)
- `GET /:id` - Get notification by ID (admin only)
- `POST /` - Create notification (trainer only)
- `POST /email` - Send email notification (admin only)
- `PATCH /:id/read` - Mark notification as read (admin only)
- `DELETE /:id` - Delete notification (admin only)

### 4. Unit Tests ✅
Comprehensive test suite using Jest and Supertest:

#### Test Files
- `tests/auth.test.js` - Auth router tests (11 test cases)
- `tests/users.test.js` - Users router tests (11 test cases) 
- `tests/sessions.test.js` - Sessions router tests (14 test cases)
- `tests/busySlots.test.js` - Busy slots router tests (13 test cases)
- `tests/notifications.test.js` - Notifications router tests (6 test cases)

#### Test Coverage
- **55 test cases total**
- Authentication and authorization testing
- CRUD operations testing
- Input validation testing
- Error handling testing
- Database interaction mocking

#### Test Setup
- `tests/setup.js` - Global test configuration
- Mocked database operations
- Mocked external dependencies (bcrypt, nodemailer)
- Helper functions for test data generation

### 5. Technical Improvements

#### Database Integration
- Fixed MySQL reserved keyword issues (escaped `read` column)
- Improved error handling with try-catch blocks
- Consistent database query patterns

#### Middleware Enhancements
- Updated auth middleware to use consistent JSON responses
- Enhanced error messages with success flags
- Proper role-based authorization

#### Code Quality
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Clean separation of concerns

## Test Results
```
Test Suites: 5 passed, 5 total
Tests:       55 passed, 55 total
```

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `utils/response.js` - Response helper utilities
- `tests/setup.js` - Test configuration
- `tests/auth.test.js` - Auth router tests
- `tests/users.test.js` - Users router tests  
- `tests/sessions.test.js` - Sessions router tests
- `tests/busySlots.test.js` - Busy slots router tests
- `tests/notifications.test.js` - Notifications router tests
- `jest.config.js` - Jest configuration

### Modified Files
- `package.json` - Added test dependencies and scripts
- `routes/auth.js` - Refactored with consistent responses
- `routes/users.js` - Enhanced CRUD operations with consistent responses
- `routes/sessions.js` - Improved session management with consistent responses
- `routes/busySlots.js` - Enhanced busy slot management with consistent responses
- `routes/notifications.js` - Improved notification handling with consistent responses
- `middleware/auth.js` - Updated to use consistent response format

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency** - All endpoints now use the same response format
2. **Reliability** - Comprehensive test coverage ensures functionality
3. **Maintainability** - Clean separation and consistent patterns
4. **Developer Experience** - Predictable API responses
5. **Quality Assurance** - Automated testing prevents regressions

## Usage

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test                # Run all tests
npm run test:watch     # Run tests in watch mode
```

### API Response Format
All successful responses:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { /* response data */ },
  "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}
```

All error responses:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message describing what went wrong"
}
```
